## What is MCP

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024 that **allows AI models to seamlessly connect to external data sources, tools, and software systems**. It acts as a universal, standardized connector (like USB-C for AI), enabling agents to securely access local files, databases, and APIs to provide context-aware, actionable, and up-to-date responses. 

You can plug MCP servers on a bunch of different AI agent environments (as MCP clients), including AI Coding tools!
