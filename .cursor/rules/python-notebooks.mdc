# Python Notebook Patterns

## Structure

1. **Title cell**: First cell is markdown with `# Topic Name`
2. **Section headers**: Use `## Subtopic Name` as markdown cells before each code section
3. **One concept per section**: Each `##` header followed by a code cell with related examples

```markdown
# Topic Name          <- First cell (markdown)

## Subtopic           <- Section header (markdown)

[code cell]           <- Examples for that subtopic
```

## Code Style

- Use f-strings for output: `print(f"Result: {value}")`
- Add comments explaining what each example demonstrates
- Group related examples in the same cell
- Show output with descriptive labels

```python
# ❌ BAD
print(x)

# ✅ GOOD
print(f"Squared: {x}")
```

## Content Guidelines

- Progress from simple to complex examples
- Include comparisons (e.g., comprehension vs for loop)
- Show common pitfalls with warnings
- Avoid infinite loops or long-running operations

## File Naming

Use numbered prefix with kebab-case: `1-topic-name.ipynb`, `2-another-topic.ipynb`
